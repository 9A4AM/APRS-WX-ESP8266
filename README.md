# APRS-WX-ESP8266 by 9A4AM@2020
This code is product of many other sample code  (WiFI connect, BME280, APRS data, WEB Server etc.
ESP8266(NodeMCU) with BME280.
- upload weather data on aprs servers
- local web page for weather informations and over internet (ddns)

WX station use BME280.
I use BME280E sensor 5V and works just fine with 3.3V.

Data will be send to APRS and WEB page.
APRS will be update every 10 minutes and WEB page every 4 seconds.


In section "SET YOUR DATA FROM HERE" just write your data and program NodeMcu with this code.

Schematic is below.
